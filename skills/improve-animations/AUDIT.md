# Animation Audit Playbook

The eight audit categories, evidence to inspect, and example values for findings and plans. Distilled from Emil Kowalski's design engineering philosophy ([emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/)). Treat values as starting points, preserve existing project tokens where appropriate, and support findings with observed user impact.

## 1. Purpose & frequency

Every animation must answer "why does this animate?" — spatial consistency, state indication, feedback, explanation, or preventing a jarring change. "It looks cool" on a frequently-seen element is not a purpose.

| Frequency | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette toggle) | Prefer immediate feedback; avoid recurring delays |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation) | Remove or drastically reduce |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts) | Standard animation |
| Rare / first-time (onboarding, feedback, celebrations) | Can add delight |

Hunt for: animations on keyboard-initiated actions, command palettes with open/close transitions (Raycast has none — correct), decorative motion on list items or hover states hit constantly. The strongest fix is often **delete the animation**.

## 2. Easing & duration

Decision order for easing:

- Entering or exiting → **`ease-out`** (starts fast, feels responsive)
- Moving / morphing on screen → **`ease-in-out`**
- Hover / color change → **`ease`**
- Constant motion (marquee, progress) → **`linear`**
- Default → **`ease-out`**

Investigate `ease-in` when its slow start delays feedback. Preserve suitable project easing tokens; these stronger curves are examples when a change is justified:

```css
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);        /* strong ease-out for UI */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);    /* strong ease-in-out for on-screen movement */
--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);     /* iOS-like drawer curve */
```

Starting duration ranges — small UI responses usually benefit from staying under 300ms:

| Element | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Button press feedback | 100–160ms |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125–200ms |
| Dropdowns, selects | 150–250ms |
| Modals, drawers | 200–500ms |
| Marketing / explanatory | Can be longer |

Investigate slow or unresponsive entrances, repeated tooltip delays, and timings that conflict with established product motion. The presence of a curve or a numeric threshold alone is not a finding.

## 3. Physicality & origin

- **Never `scale(0)`** — nothing in the real world appears from nothing. Target: `scale(0.9–0.97)` + `opacity: 0`.
- **Popovers/dropdowns/tooltips scale from their trigger**, not center:
  ```css
  .popover { transform-origin: var(--transform-origin); } /* Base UI */
  ```
  **Modals are exempt** — they appear centered; `transform-origin: center` is correct there. Do not report it.
- **Press feedback**: `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active` with `transition: transform 160ms ease-out`. Keep it subtle (0.95–0.98).

Hunt for: `scale(0)`, pure-fade entrances with no initial transform, `transform-origin: center` (or none) on trigger-anchored elements, pressable elements with no press feedback.

## 4. Interruptibility

For rapidly triggered or reversible motion, verify that the implementation retargets from the current state without jumps. Transitions and springs commonly support this; restarting a keyframe sequence may require explicit continuity handling.

- Entry without JS: `@starting-style` (legacy fallback: a `data-mounted` attribute set in `useEffect`).
- Gesture-driven motion should use springs — they carry velocity when interrupted.
- Spring configs, Apple-style (recommended): `{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }`. Keep bounce subtle (0.1–0.3); reserve visible bounce for drag-to-dismiss and playful moments.
- **Asymmetric timing**: deliberate phases (press, hold, destructive confirm) animate slower; the system's response snaps. Report symmetric timing when it delays the system response or obscures a deliberate hold.

Hunt for: `@keyframes` on toasts/toggles/rapidly-triggered UI, gesture handlers that tween with fixed-duration keyframes, drags without velocity-based dismissal (dismiss on `Math.abs(distance)/elapsedMs > ~0.11`, not distance thresholds alone), hard stops at drag boundaries instead of rising friction.

## 5. Performance

- **Prefer `transform` and `opacity` for motion that does not need to change layout.** When layout animation is necessary, such as an accordion, inspect rendering cost and interaction quality rather than replacing the behavior blindly.
- **`transition: all`** animates unintended properties off-GPU — always a finding.
- **Check the installed Motion version and rendering path before making acceleration claims.** Compare shorthand props and full transform strings only when performance evidence warrants it; verify the chosen form under representative load.
- **Don't drive child transforms via a CSS variable on the parent** — it recalcs styles for all children. Set `transform` directly on the element.
- Prefer browser-managed animation for predetermined motion and JS/springs where dynamic control is useful. Verify performance on the actual rendering path.
- Keep transition-time `filter: blur()` under 20px — heavy blur is expensive, especially in Safari.

Hunt for: `transition: all`, animated layout properties, Framer Motion shorthand props on busy pages, `setProperty('--x', …)` driving child transforms, rAF loops doing what CSS could.

## 6. Accessibility

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .element { animation: fade 0.2s ease; } /* keep opacity/color, drop movement */
}
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .element:hover { transform: scale(1.05); } /* touch fires false hovers on tap */
}
```

Respect reduced-motion preferences by removing unnecessary movement. Immediate updates or brief opacity changes can both preserve understandable feedback. In JS, `useReducedMotion()` can select the appropriate behavior.

Hunt for: movement with no `prefers-reduced-motion` handling, ungated `:hover` motion, reduced-motion implementations that hide state changes or necessary feedback.

## 7. Cohesion & tokens

- Motion should match the product's personality — playful can be bouncier, a dashboard stays crisp. Mismatched personality across components is a finding.
- Curves and durations should live as shared tokens. Five hand-typed cubic-beziers that almost match is a consolidation finding.
- Everything-at-once group entrances where a **30–80ms stagger** belongs. Stagger is decorative — it must never block interaction.
- A jarring crossfade that shows two overlapping states can be masked with subtle `filter: blur(2px)` during the transition.

Hunt for: duplicated near-identical easings/durations, one bouncy component in a crisp app, list/grid entrances whose timing obscures hierarchy, crossfades that visibly double-expose.

## 8. Missed opportunities

The additive category — places that don't animate but should:

- State changes that teleport (content swaps, layout jumps) where a brief transition would prevent a jarring change.
- Spatially-connected UI (a panel that appears from a trigger) with no motion explaining where it came from.
- Rare, high-emotion moments (first-run, success, celebration) rendered with none of the delight budget they're allowed.
- `translate` percentages (`translateY(100%)` = element's own height) and `clip-path: inset()` reveals as tools for these — no hardcoded pixel offsets.

Report at most a handful, grounded in actual UX seams you observed — not a wishlist.
